### LinkedInLearning MEAN Tutorial

Today we just individually followed the MEAN tutorial on LinkedInLearning. The tutor was there to help with problem solving if any occured. Where I got to on the tutorial was taking the textarea input and ouputing it into the console. The only problem I had while following the tutorials was that I couldn't shorten all the Angular Material imports into 1 line.
