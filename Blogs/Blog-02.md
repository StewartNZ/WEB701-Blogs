### Milestone 1 Assignment 2

This class we went over Milestone 1 of the assignment 2, Design. This milestone involves designing our project and doing the Information Architecture for it. The main thing we went over in class was the Information Architecture and what is involved in completing it. The requirements seem to not be that different from last year's WEB601 information architecture which will hopefully make it easier to do as I already have an understanding of what is required.
Another thing we had to decide this class was what our site was going to be for, we were told it had to be for a donation charity, real or made up, and we were given a set of requirements that our site will need to have. For my site I have decided to it for the SPCA and have it based around the idea of donating animal foods, bedding and other items related to pets and animals. This is different than the charity that already exists for SPCA because that one only allows donating money directly.
