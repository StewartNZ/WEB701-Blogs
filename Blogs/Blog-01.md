### Introduction to WEB701

In this class we went through the course outline and had an introduction to the assignments where we had to create a presentation in groups describing each part of the assignment.

- Assessment 1 is doing a journal every week about what happened in classes and what work you've done out of class as well.
- Assessment 2 contains both milestone 1 and milestone 2 for the main project.
    - Milestone 1 is about designing your website for a charity of your choice using informational architecture.
    - Milestone 2 is about evaluating and documenting the differences between Vue and Angular. It also involves showing a prototype of each and explaining what choice you will make for your final assignment.
- Assessment 3 is the final milestone/assignment which involves developing the site into a fully working state and also includes a small essay about the technology used in creating the site.
