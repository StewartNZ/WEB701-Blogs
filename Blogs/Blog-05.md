### Milestone 3

I have completed as much as I am wanting to complete on my website implementation. One part of what I have implemented on the frontend is the ability to sign up and login. Signing up on the frontend will only create an account with the user role. On the frontend when logged in you can also enter a donation code and see a list of previous donation codes entered. This list will show if they have been verified or not and if so, it shows when and how many points where given for it. When logged in as a Moderator you can view a list of unverified donation codes and verify them. 

A feature I would have added later would be to show when the code was entered and if it has not been verified for a long time to either delete that code or mark it as invalid. Another feature I have not added into the backend is a check to stop someone creating an admin or moderator account through an application such as postman. What I would have done to stop would be to have it so if a role other than user is send you must also send an access token with the admin role. This would be done on the frontend through the admin board but currently this is not used. Another feature I would have added later would be the ability for admins to add vouchers as well the ability for users to purchase vouchers. I had started setting this up by having a schema in the backend but that is as far as I got.
